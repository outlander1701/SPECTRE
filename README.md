# SPECTRE

## Project Description
SPECTRE: Supersonic Phase-change Ejector Cycle for Thermal Refrigeration Efficiency. This projects computationally models various refrigeration cycles and compares them to a novel refrigeration cycle based on a two-phase supersonic ejector.

## Results
This project is currently a work in progress. Results will completed soon.
